My Plugin plan: 

Create plugin tool that is controllable through
GUI sliders of program.

Idea for tool - Maya to Unreal LOD creator and exporter:

  I want my tool to create LODS automatically by:
  - Creating 4 duplicate meshes of asset
  - Rename correctly (LOD0, LOD1…)
  - Decimating them with controls for getting desired
    result
  - Controls for ensuring smooth clean Texture coordinates
    so that there is no unwanted warping
  - Set pivot / freeze transforms
  - Export FBX with correct settings
  - Import manually in Unreal    
 
  Project Criteria:
 
 - Has to be done using Python

 - Has to give a solution to a problem/need in
  in the industry

1. User Guide

2. Tool itself

3. Video Presentation

*All with Academic references and citations!

Time left - 5 weeks


Plan:

-   Research ways to create plugin,
    and decide if to go forward with idea

-   Finish writing proposal

-  Decide on a second proposal idea...

Plan:

- Get confutable with Maya's existing LOD pipeline (minimal external plugins):

    - Download an LOD Asset from Fab and study its LOD structure
    - export the separate levels into Maya (study the different options and settings)***
    - try to create you're own LOD using you're custom asset 
      following the standard way...

- Finish writing proposal


- Send to Omar and Anna (Listen to Annas advice)
